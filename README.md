## What is it?

This is an application that was made with only one purpose: to do something with Vanilla JS and remember what a pain it is.

## How to work?

Simply. Only what I have to do is spend some time clicking on interesting or your favourite artists/songs.
Additionally there is a search input, so if your have very strange music tastes, you will be able to find it no matter what.
